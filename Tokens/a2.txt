voice
acting
in
japan
throughout
the
anime
media
rica
matsumoto
has
always
provided
the
original
japanese
voice
of
ash
for
the
english
dubbing
veronica
taylor
provided
the
voice
of
ash
in
the
first
eight
seasons
of
the
english
adaption
of
the
pokmon
anime
which
was
dubbed
by
4kids
entertainment
at
the
time
of
her
audition
taylor
stated
that
the
character
was
temporarily
named
casey
which
was
the
name
later
given
to
a
recurring
character
in
johto
after
the
script
was
translated
from
japanese
the
lines
were
adapted
to
fit
the
movements
of
the
characters
mouth
called
lip
flap
all
the
voices
were
recorded
separately
so
taylor
was
the
only
one
in
the
booth
when
she
recorded
her
lines
which
took
approximately
six
to
eight
hours
per
episode
taylor
was
often
the
first
person
to
record
so
she
had
to
imagine
how
the
previous
line
will
be
said
luckily
i
work
with
a
great
director
who
helps
with
the
interpretation
of
the
line
matching
of
the
lip
flap
and
consistency
of
the
voice
taylor
enjoyed
playing
ash
because
of
his
low
husky
voice
and
energy
and
excitement
taylor
commented
that
ash
and
the
other
characters
loosened
up
after
the
first
ten
episodes
of
the
anime
she
believed
the
writers
were
more
relaxed
and
no
longer
felt
the
pressure
of
making
sure
everything
was
done
correctly
taylor
commented
i
enjoy
playing
ash
now
much
more
than
i
did
in
the
very
beginning
because
i
can
have
fun
with
him
more
and
we
kind
of
know
him
and
can
work
out
how
he
really
would
react
we
have
the
classic
ash
responses
and
things
like
that
sarah
natochenny
replaced
taylor
in
season
nine
when
the
pokmon
company
international
known
at
that
time
as
pokmon
usa

shelter
under
a
hollow
tree
however
he
noticed
a
group
of
pokmon

from
the
rain
so
he
invited
them
inside
the
tree
and
the
pokmon
kept
him
safe
and
warm

experience
is
what
inspired

into
becoming
a
pokmon

of
the
seventeenth

xy
series
giving
chase
at
the
rhyhorn

to
ash
in
this
episode
in
the
anime
the
series
starts
with
ashs
tenth
birthday
which
according
to
pokmon
trainer
registration
bylaws
allowed
him
to
become
a
fullfledged
pokmon
trainer
and
obtain
a
starter
pokmon
as
a
tenyearold
hailing
from
pallet
town
in
the
kanto
region
ash
was
offered
a
choice
between
three
pokmon
as
his
starter
bulbasaur
squirtle
and
charmander
while
he
was
planning
to
choose
squirtle
he
received
the
electric
type
pokmon
pikachu
from
professor
oak
instead
because
he
woke
up
late
and
all
the
other
starter
pokmon
had
been
taken
by
other
trainers
after
receiving
pikachu
and
a
pokdex
ash
left
pallet
town
to
start
his
journey
since
then
ash
has
traveled
the
world
of
pokmon
competed
in
many
challenges
and
caught
newer
pokmon
he
has
met
many
companions
such
as
misty
and
brock
throughout
the
series
ashs
primary
enemies
are
a
pokmon
crime
organization
called
team
rocket
specifically
the
two
comical
and
bumbling
members
jessie
and
james
and
their
talking
meowth
who
is
essentially
the
third
member
of
the
group
ever
since
being
defeated
by
ashs
pikachu
in
the
second
episode
pokmon
emergency
the
three
of
them
have
obsessively
never
stopped
chasing
after
them
to
steal
ashs
pikachu
maintaining
the
delusion
that
pikachu
is
abnormally
powerful
and
presenting
it
to
their
criminal
boss
would
make
them
very
rich
as
the
enduring
comical
villains
of
the
series
the
team
rocket
trio
occasionally
show
signs
of
goodness
such
as
care
and
friendship
with
their
pokmon
and
each
other
and
despite
their
constant
antagonism
they
occasionally
put
their
differences
aside
and
work
together
with
ash
against
a
common
threat
such
as
in
pokmon
the
movie
2000
where
they
aid
ash
in
retrieving
the
three
treasures
in
order
to
save
the
world

travels

still
had
a
lot
to
learn
as
a
trainer
he
caught
his
pokmon
by
merely
befriending
them
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
battling
and
many
of
his
gym
badges
were
earned
rather
controversially
in
fact
the
only
legitimate
victories
were
over
lt
surge
koga
and
blaine
while
the
others
were
earned
on
technical
convenience
or
given
to
him
out
of
gratitude
ash
also
shows
a
deep
love
for
pokmon
in
the
series
protecting
wild

to
his
inexperience
in
handling
his
more
powerful
pokmon

cameron
and
virgil
most
of
whom
he
befriends
unlike
previous
seasons
ash
notoriously
displays
a
drop
in
skill
and
competence
and
instead
regresses
back
to
a
beginner
showing
little
of
his
previous
expertise
and
relearns
many
of
the
basics
of
catching
pokmon
however
ash
still
manages
to
win
all
eight
gym
badges
in
unova

and
foiling
both
team
rocket

bid
each
other
farewell
ash
then
ventured
to
the
kalos
region
to
challenge
the
kalos
league
as
well
as
learn
more
about
mega
evolution
a
transformation
that
can
take
certain
fully
evolved
pokmon
to
a
more
powerful
temporary
form
while
there
he
began
traveling
with
the
siblings
clemont
and
bonnie
along
with
serena
whom
he
had
met
during
a
summer
camp
in

pokmon
that
can
megaevolve

group
discovers
that
his
greninja
is
capable
of
bond
phenomenon
a
transformation
where
ash
and
greninja
connect
mentally
and
greninjas
body
changes
to
a
color
scheme
resembling
ash
like
mega
evolution
the
transformation
is
temporary
and
makes
ashgreninja
much
more
powerful
and
well
capable
of
defeating
megaevolved
pokmon
currently
no
other
known
pokmon
in
existence
is
capable
of
bond
phenomenon
and
several
rivals
have
taken
great
interest
in
competing
with
it
in
the
kalos
league
with
their
own
megaevolving
pokmon
like
before

earns
all
eight
gym
badges
qualifying
him
to
compete
in

kalos
league
and
with
his
newest
pokmon
ash
defeats
many
opponents
and
their
megaevolved
pokmon
advancing
all
the
way

they

however
he

not

for
the

faced
criticism
from
fans
when
ash
lost
the
kalos
league
against
alain
the
pokmon
fandom
specifically
criticized
the
episode
due
to
misleading
trailers
that
suggested
that
ash
would
win
the
battle
and
because
ash
had
lost
all
of
the
pokmon
leagues
in

seasons
fans
also
disliked
the
outcome
because
they
believed
ashs
greninja
had
many
advantages
over
alains
charizard
including
the
fact
that
watertype
pokmon
resist
attacks
from

that
the

to

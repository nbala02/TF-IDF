league
episodes
as
it
would

with

and
hoenn
league
episodes
and
it
would
have
avoided
offending
people
during
february
due
to
the

controversy
however
one
exception
was
in
the

alleging
that
jynxs
design
bore
a
striking
resemblance
to
blackface
actors
an
image
considered
racist
against
black
people
and
further
described
the
pokmon
as
a
dead
ringer
for
an
obese
drag
queen
she
further
criticized
the
pokmon
in
the
magazine
advertising
age
comparing
it
to
little
black
sambo
and
suggesting
its
english
name
as
also
a
possible
derogatory
remark
towards
blacks
relating
to
voodoo
with
its
original
japanese
name
rougela
being
unrelated
since

barriers
with
such
in
their

they
emphasized
it
further
noting
the

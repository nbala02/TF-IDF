was
one
of
151
different
designs
conceived

game
freaks
character
development
team
and
finalized
by
ken
sugimori
for
the
first
generation
of
pocket
monsters
games
red
and
green
which
were
localized
outside
japan
as
pokmon
red
and
blue
originally
called
gyarados
in
japanese
nintendo
decided
to
give
the
various
pokmon
species
clever
and
descriptive
names
related
to
their
appearance
or
features
when
translating
the
game
for
western
audiences
as
a
means
to
make
the
characters
more
relatable
to
american
children
as
a
result
the
species
beta
name
was
skulkraken
a
combination
of
skull
or
skulk
and
kraken
but
in
the
final
release
the
original
japanese
name
was
used
gyarados
is
a
large
sea
serpent
pokmon
most
similar
in
appearance
to
dragons
seen
in
chinese
mythology
the
concept
of
magikarp
evolving
into
gyarados
is
based
on
the
ancient
chinese
tradition
that
the
carp
would
evolve
into
a
dragon
after
swimming
upstream
its
snakelike
body
is
largely
blue
but
its
underbelly
is
pale
yellow
it
has
four
white
fins
down
its
back
and
a
large
and
gaping
mouth
gyarados
is
known
for
its
fierce
temper
and
wanton
destructive
tendencies
once
it
has
worked
itself
into
a
frenzy
it
will
not
calm
until
everything
around
it
is
destroyed
and
can
even
go
on
for
a
whole
month
this
violent
nature
is
attributed
to
the
dramatic
structural
changes
its
brain
undergoes
during
evolution
during
times
of
human
conflict
gyarados
are
said
to
appear
burning
entire
cities
down
to
the

described

powerhouse
and
gamespy
editor
justin
leeper
called

a
choice
for
more
macho
gamers
ign
called
it
one
of
the
most
powerful
pokmon
ever
encountered
comparing
it
to
the
image
of
chinese
mythological
dragons
they
also
listed
it
as
one
of
the
best
flying
type
pokmon
describing
it
as
a
flying
sea
snake
author
ash
dekirk
wrote
that
gyarados
and
magikarp
were
inspired
by
the
asiatic
myth
of
the
dragon
gate
he
adds
that
it
is
scaled
in
sapphire
with
catfish
barbels
on
its
somewhat
blunted
snout

loredane
lipperini
similarly
described
gyarados
as
resembling
something
from
the
chinese
new
year
igns
pokmon
of
the
day
chick
expressed
dismay
at
gyarados
in
pokmon
crystal
commenting
that
while
in
its
predecessors
pokmon
red
blue
and
yellow
it
was
one
of
the
most
valuable
pokmon
they
ruined
it
by
giving
it
very
low
special
attack
in
this
game
ign
described
the
growth
from
pokmon
diamond
and
pearl
to
pokmon
black
and
white
as
possibly
being
the
series
biggest
evolution
since
magikarp
morphed
into
gyarados
ign
commented
that
a
pokmon
game
better
than
black
and
white
was
pokmon
snap
citing
one
of
their
favorite
experiences
as
where
the
player
can
throw
pester
balls
at
a
magikarp
to
make
it
evolve
into
gyarados
and
attack
the
player
author
tracy
west
named
gyarados
the
fourth
best
watertype
pokmon
ign
readers
voted
gyarados
as
the
11th
best
pokmon
editor
sam
wrote
this
iconic
flying
and
water
type
pokmon
from
the
first
generation
of
games
epitomizes
the
trials
and
tribulations
of
training
even
the
lamest
of
pokmon
he
says
further
sure
everyone
made
fun
of
you
as
you
toted
around
a
magikarp
but
whos
laughing
now
now
that
its
evolved
into
a
badass
sea
dragon
gyarados
in
the
newest
iteration
of
the
series
pokmon
go
the
gyarados
is
evolved
by
obtaining
400
magikarp
candies
this
continues
the
traditional
difficulty
but
worthiness
of
obtaining
a
gyarados

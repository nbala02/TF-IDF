reactions
to

portrayal
have
been
divided
reviewers

as

for

of
pocket

games
red
and
green
known
outside
japan
as
pokmon
red
and
blue
its
name
which
means
the
second
of
mew
derives
from
its
existence
as
a
genetic
duplicate
of
the
original
mew
until
the
first
pokmon
movie
was
released
in
the
united
states
mewtwo
was
rarely
referred
to
as
a
clone
in
japanese
sources
kubo
masakazu
executive
producer
of
mewtwo
strikes
back
explained
that
they
intentionally
avoid
using
the
term
kuron
clone
because
the
word
has
a
frightening
feel
despite
being
mews
descendant
mewtwo
directly
precedes
mew
in
the
games
numerical
pokmon
index
owing
to
the
latters
secret
inclusion
by
game
freak
programmer
shigeki
morimoto
during
an
interview
pokmon
company
president
tsunekazu
ishihara
stated
that
mewtwo
was
expected
to
be
popular
with
north
american
audiences
citing
their
preference
for
strong
powerful
characters
despite
being
mews
clone
mewtwos
appearance
is
very
different
in
comparison
it
appears
as
a
bipedal
feline
that
is
6
feet
7
inches
201
cm
tall
and
has
a
white
body
with
a
pronounced
purple
tail
and
stomach
purple
pupils
bulbous
fingertips
feline
head
and
a
mass
of
flesh
that
connects
from
the
center
of
its
back
to
its
head
behind
its
neck
its
appearance
has
been
likened
to
an
oversized
cross
of
cat
squirrel
and
kangaroo
in
the
original
games
mewtwo
is
intended
to
be
the
strongest
pokmon
ever
as
a
result
of
being
cloned
from
a
sample
of
mews
dna
mewtwo
is
an
extremely
powerful
psychic
yet
its
abilities
surpass
mews
due
to
intentional
alterations
to
the
genetic
source
material
it
was
cloned
from
as
such
it
can
use
telekinesis
for
flight
to
shield
itself
or
to
powerfully
throw
opponents
aside
in
addition
it
is
among
the
very
few
pokmon
capable
of
human
speech
which
it
does
so
via
telepathy
otherwise
it
conserves
its
energy
until
needed
in
addition
to
its
psychic
abilities
mewtwo
can
regenerate
which
allows
it
to
quickly
recover
from
nearfatal
injuries
despite
being
mews
clone
mewtwo
does
not
share
its
ability
to
learn
every
single
teachable
move
within
the
games
as
a
character
in
the
games
mewtwos
physical
appearance
is
not
its
only
stark
divergence
from
mew
while
the
alterations
to
the
genetic
source
material
it
was
cloned
resulted
in
its
abilities
surpassing
mews
it
also
resulted
in
mewtwo
developing
a
vicious
personality
that
is
primarily
interested
in
proving
its
own
strength
the
franchises
nonvideo
game
media
particularly
the
anime
has
expanded
upon
the
character
in
the
most
notable
instance
mewtwo
telepathically
speaks
with
a
male
voice
and
is
existentially
torn
over
its
purpose
in
the
world
appearances
in
video
games
in
pokmon
red
and
blue
the
player
learns
of
mewtwos
existence
by
reading
research
notes
left
in
the
ruined
pokmon
mansion
on
cinnabar
island
the
notes
say
that
the
islands
scientists
discovered
a
new
pokmon
in
a
guyana
jungle
that
they
named
it
mew
and
that
it
later
gave
birth
to
a
creature
they
called
mewtwo
the
games
pokdex
entry
states
that
mewtwo
was
created
by
a
scientist
after
years
of
horrific
gene
splicing
and
dna
engineering
experiments
mewtwo
proved
too
mighty
to
control
destroying
the
laboratory
and
escaping
the
player
is
later
given
an
opportunity
to
capture
mewtwo
in
the
